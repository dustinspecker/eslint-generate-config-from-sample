# eslint-generate-config-from-sample

> Create an ESLint config for existing code

***WARNING: THIS IS SUPER, SUPER EXPERIMENTAL***

It seems to be kind of working.

## Install
```
npm install --global eslint-generate-config-from-sample
```

Not currently published on npm, so actually need to do:

1. `git clone https://github.com/dustinspecker/eslint-generate-config-from-sample.git`
2. `cd eslint-generate-config-from-sample`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm i -g`
5. Navigate to directory where desired `.eslintrc` file should exist
6. Run `eslint-generate-config-from-sample <file>` on a file to build a rule set for ESLint.

## Usage
Provide a file to analyze like so:

```
eslint-generate-config-from-sample <FILE>
```

`eslint-generate-config-from-sample` only works with a single file for the time being.

`eslint-generate-config-from-sample` will then begin using computer magic (brute forcing the discoverable combintations of rule configurations) to create an ESLint file (`.eslintrc`).

## How it works

1. It looks at every built-in ESLint rules' schema to determine possible configuration possibilities
2. It then tries every single combination on the provided file
3. If at least one of the combinations passes, then it will write one of them to the new `.eslintrc`
4. If zero combinations work, then it will write 'off' for that rule in the new `.eslintrc`

There are already most likely impossible rule configurations such as the [indent](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/indent) because the option is any number. For now, we're ignoring those configurations, but wil try the other configurations. For example, looking at the [indent definition](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/master/lib/rules/indent.js) we can determine that `"tab"` is configuration to try.

## TODO
 - actually have tests on `src/index.js`
 - refactor the eye bleedingly bad code in `src/rules.js`
 - support sampling multiple files
 - handle rule configurations that allow a number (ignored for now)*
 - handle rule configurations that allow a string (ignored for now)*
 - ECMA Features
  - `impliedStrict`
 - environment detection
 - rules
  - `comma-dangle`
  - `no-multi-spaces`
  - `max-len`
 - find a better name because `eslint-generate-config-from-sample` does not roll off the tongue

\* - might be impossible
